# Offline SDK Licensing (.NET)

This repo contains tools & docs to protect an SDK that targets .NET (including .NET Framework, .NET Core, Mono, Unity, .NET Standard, and more). Basics of SDK licensing in Cryptolens is covered in [this article](https://help.cryptolens.io/licensing-models/sdk-licensing). The technique described here is different from the original tutorial, and the focus is on supporting offline environments (i.e. end users do not need to contact the server to verify the license). It is also more secure since developers need to explicitly specify which applications will use the SDK.

## Clarification of terms

* **Vendor** - the company that wants to protect an SDK
* **Developer** - someone that will use the SDK in their own applications
* **End users** - someone who will use the application developed by the developer.

## Getting started

Please select what fits best:

* [I'm a vendor](Vendor.md)
* [I'm a developer](Developer.md)
